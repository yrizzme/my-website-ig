    <div class="substack-post-embed"><p lang="en">snickers</p>

    a snickers bar lay before me. I carefully tear open its fragile wrapper, releasing the sweet, iconic scent. my finger gracefully glides over the ripples of silky milk chocolate on the top of the bar. as i sink my teeth into heaven, the tantalising taste of milk chocolate, luscious caramel, chewy nougat and crunchy peanuts grace my tongue. in mere seconds, it's gone, only leaving the wrapper and some creamy milk chocolate on my lips as evidence of its tasty existence.</p><a data-comment-link href="https://substack.com/@yrizzme/" target="_blank">- yahya rizmi on substack</a>
